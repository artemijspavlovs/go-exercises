I ask ChatGPT to give me differently themed, realistic (I hate the theoretic, algorithmic tasks that I'll never actually use) technical interview tasks and solve (and try my best to write tests, god bless my soul) them here.

Each task contains a README file with the initial task description, use them to practice if you want! :)
